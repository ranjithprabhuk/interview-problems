A curated collection of technical interview problems categorized by topic and difficulty level. This repository aims to help developers prepare for technical interviews with a comprehensive set of problems and solutions.

## Categories

- [Array Problems](array.md) - Collection of array manipulation and algorithm problems
- [String Problems](string.md) - String manipulation and pattern matching problems
- [Object Problems](objects.md) - JavaScript/TypeScript object-oriented programming problems
- [SQL Problems](sql.md) - Database and SQL query problems
- [Data Structure Problems](data-structures.md) - Implementation and usage of various data structures
- [Interview Questions](interview-questions.md) - Junior level and Senior level problems

## Problem Distribution

Each category contains:
- 10 Easy Problems
- 10 Medium Problems
- 10 Hard Problems

Total: 150 problems across all categories and difficulty levels

## Difficulty Levels

- üü¢ **Easy**: Fundamental concepts and basic problem-solving
- üü° **Medium**: Intermediate algorithms and data structures
- üî¥ **Hard**: Complex problems requiring advanced knowledge

## Structure

Each problem includes:
- Clear problem statement
- Input/Output examples
- Time/Space complexity (where applicable)
- Sample test cases
- Expected solutions
- Implementation (for data structure problems)

Example format:
```
1. **Problem Name**
   - Problem: [Clear description of the problem]
   - Input: [Example input]
   - Output: [Expected output]
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
```

## How to Use

1. Choose a category that you want to practice
2. Start with easy problems and progressively move to harder ones
3. Try to solve the problem on your own first
4. Check the suggested solution after attempting the problem
5. Focus on understanding the approach rather than memorizing solutions

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. To contribute:
